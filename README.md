### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steve

I'm a principal researcher at Statistics Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ where I use economics and data science to measure the economy. Prior to working at Statistics Canada, I completed my PhD in economics where I examined firmsâ€™ corporate social responsibility and its implication for the efficient provision of public goods.

I work on open-source software in my spare time. Most of my repos are about building tools in R (and sometimes Python) to measure inflation ðŸ“ˆ.
